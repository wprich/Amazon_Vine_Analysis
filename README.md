# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to gain exposure to Spark as well as creating a pipeline of Amazon reviews on certain products.  This pipeline was then used to see whether there was bias among certain paid and non paid reviews on Amazon products.  This process and the techniques used herein can easily be used to a multitude of projects using any number of services.  AWS was also utilized as a data storage option and to interact with SQL.

## Results

This one image will provide all information necessary as this image shows: the number of paid and non-paid reviews, how many paid and non-paid reviews were 5 stars, and lastly, what percentage of the reviews were 5 star reviews for both paid and non-paid.

## Results

The image shows all figures requested by the client and the ratios needed for analysis.  At first glance it could be said that there does seem to be some positivity bias among the paid reviews group.  However, given that the actual number of reviews that meet all the criteria needed is noticeably lower than the non-paid group.  It is my belief that more data would need to be collected to make an accurate decision on whether bias exists among these two data sets.  Other types of analysis could also be used to see if some bias exists as well.  For example, we have not accounted for the same customer leaving multiple reviews, or if any of the customers are professional reviewers.  Another analysis that could be done on the data is the price of the item in question that the review is left on.  Is the item brand new or used?  Is the item priced at market value or sold at a discount?  These do play a factor in a customers review as products on sale typically get higher reviews for the lower price.
